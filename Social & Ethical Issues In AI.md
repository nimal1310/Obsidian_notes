1. **Definition of morality and ethics in AI**

- *Morality*
	- It refers to principle that govern behavior,distinguishing between rights and wrong based on societal,cultural ,personal values.
	- `In AI morality deals with how AI systems should behave ethically in various human context.`
	
- *Ethics*
	- This are formalized rules or principles or guidelines that outline acceptable behavior within specific domain.
	- `In AI ethics focuses on creating principles to ensure AI technologies do not harm individual or society.`
	
- *Report structure*
	1. Social Impacts
		- Potential impact of AI on labour market and economy 
		- different demographic people are ill treated, inequality,human rights,privacy.
		
	2.  Psychological Impacts:
	3. Financial Imapacts
	4. Legal system
	5. Environmental impacts
	6. Impact on trust

2. **Impact on society**
	- LABOUR MARKET
		- Human power replaced with AI and automation
		- AI was implemented almost all the fields. 
		- Impact on economic growth and productivity
		
			- Economists are generally enthusiastic about the prospects of AI on economic growth. Roboticsadded an estimated 0.4 percentage points of annual GDP growth and labour productivity for countries between 1993 and 2007, which is of a similar magnitude to the impact of the introduction of steam engines on growth in the United Kingdom (Graetz and Michaels, 2015)
			
		- impact on the workforce
		
			-  Economists also disagree on the relative impactof AI and robotics. One study asked 1,896 experts about the impact of emerging technologies; *48 percent believed that robots and digital agents would displace significant numbers of both 'blue'and 'white' collar workers,* with many expressing concern that this would lead to vast increases in income inequality, large numbers of unemployable people, and breakdowns in the social order(Smith and Anderson, 2014)
			
			- Regardless, it is clear that a range of sectors will be affected. Frey and Osborne (2013) calculate that there is a high probability that 47 percent of U.S. workers will see their jobs become automated over the next 20 years. According to their analysis, *telemarketers, title examiners, hand sewers,mathematical technicians, insurance underwriters, watch repairers, cargo agents, tax preparers,photographic process workers, new accounts clerks, library technicians, and data-entry specialists have a 99 percent chance of having their jobs computerised*
			
		- Labour market discrimination: Effect on different demographic
			- Different demographic will be affected to varying extent and some are more at risk than others from emerging technologies.
			- According to the U.S. Department of Education (2014), there will be a 14 percent increase in STEM(Science ,Technology ,Engineering ,Math) jobs between 2010 and 2020 — but 'only 16 percent of American high school seniors are proficient in mathematics and interested in a STEM career.
			- Women may also be disproportionately affected, as more women work in caregiving positions — one of the sectors likely to be affected by robots.

	- INEQUALITY:
		- Inequality: exploitation of workers 
		
			- Changes in employment related to automation and digitisation will not be expressed solely via job losses, as AI is expected to create many numerous and new forms of employment .
			- Building AI most often requires people to manage and clean up data to instruct the training algorithms. Better (and safer) AI needs huge training data sets and a whole new outsourced industry has sprung up all over the world to meet this need.
			
		- Sharing Benefits 
		
			- A US report on AI, automation, and the economy (2016) highlights the importance of ensuring that potential benefits of AI do not accumulate unequally, and are made accessible to as many people as possible
			- To ensure that AI's benefits are distributed fairly 
			- New guidelines and laws are made to provide the AI driven technologies to all the citizens.
			
		- Concentration of power among elites(Premium):
		
			- The power of AI are only in the hands of the internet giants in the world their company dependent full on that.
			- he accumulation of technological, economic and political power in the hands of the top five players Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon – affords them undue influence in areas of society relevant to opinion-building in democracies: governments, legislators, civil society, political parties, schools and education, journalism and journalism education and — most importantly — science and Research
			- Power of those big companies in different areas like (Financial,Public disclosure,collecting personal data)
			
		- Political instability:

	- PRIVACY ,HUMAN RIGHTS & DIGNITY:
		-   AI will have profound impacts on privacy in the next decade. The privacy and dignity of AI users must be carefully considered when designing service, care and companion robots, as working in people's homes means they will be privy to intensely private moments (such as bathing and dressing). However, other aspects of AI will also affect privacy. Smith (2018), President of Microsoft, recently remarked
		
		- Any one of us can be identified by facial recognition software or data mining of our shopping of social media habits (Pasquale, 2015). These online habits may indicate not just our identity, but our political or economic predispositions, and what strategies might be effective for changing these
		
		- Machine learning allows us to extract information from data and discover new patterns, and is able to turn seemingly innocuous data into sensitive, personal data. For example, patterns of social media use can predict personality categories, political preferences, and even life outcomes
		
		- AI applications based on machine learning need access to large amounts of data, but data subjects have limited rights over how their data are used (Veale et al., 2018). Recently, the EU adopted new **General Data Protection Regulations** (GDPR) to protect citizen privacy. However, the regulations only apply to personal data, and not the aggregated 'anonymous' data that are usually used to train models.
	- BIAS:
		- AI is created by humans, which means it can be susceptible to bias. Systematic bias may arise as a result of the data used to train systems, or as a result of values held by system developers and users. It most frequently occurs when machine learning applications are trained on data that only reflect certain demographic groups, or which reflect societal biases
		- `Example:`
			- The investigative journalism organisation ProPublica showed that COMPAS, a machine learning based software deployed in the US to assess the probability of a criminal defendant re-offending, was strongly biased against black Americans. *The COMPAS system was more likely to incorrectly predict that black defendants would reoffend, while simultaneously, and incorrectly, predicting the opposite in the case of white defendants*
			
			- Researchers have found that *automated advertisement distribution tools are more likely to distribute adverts for well-paid jobs to men than women* (Datta et al., 2015). AI-informed recruitment is susceptible to bias; an Amazon self-learning tool used to judge job-seekers was found to significantly favour men, ranking them highly 

			- Such databases regularly portray women performing kitchen chores while men are out hunting
			
			-  Searches for 'wedding gowns produce the standard white version favoured in western societies, while Indian wedding gowns are categorised as 'performance art' or 'costumes
	- DEMOCRACY :
		- As already discussed, the concentration of technological, economic and political power among a few mega corporations could allow them undue influence over governments — but the adoption and implementation of AI could threaten democracy in other ways too
		- Fake news and social media
		- This may be a good thing for politicians, but there is a great deal of evidence that AI-powered technologies have been systematically misused to manipulate citizens in recent elections, damaging democracy.
		
		- *During the 2016 US presidential election, pro-Trump bots have been found to have infiltrated the online spaces used by pro-Clinton campaigners, where they spread highly automated content,*
		- A recent report found that at least 28 countries — including both authoritarian states and democracies — employ 'cyber troops' to manipulate public opinion over major social networking applications 
		- **The end of democracies**
			- Some commentators have questioned whether democracies are particularly suited to the age of AI and machine learning, and whether its deployment will enable countries with other political systems to gain the advantage 

3. **Impact on human psychology:**
	- RELATIONSHIP 
		- Relationships with others form the core of human existence. In the future, robots are expected to serve humans in various social roles: nursing, housekeeping, caring for children and the elderly, teaching, and more. 
		- *Human-robot relationships*
			- In future human may have the personal robots to perform different activities.
			- Attacker or bad intended person try to manipulate and deception the personal robot to do things on his favour.
			- Human dependent on the robot this is also a issue.
			- It may be difficult to predict the psychological effect of forming relationship with a robot.
			- Enjoying a relationship with robot may cause harm to human.
		-  *Human-Human relationship*
			- Robots may affect the stability of marital or sexual relationship( feelings of jealousymay emerge if a partner is spending time with a robot, such as a 'virtual girlfriend)
			- Loss contact with our companion or fellow humans.
			- Humans face issue or uncomfortable with peer humans so they have a relationship with robot.
			- There was argue among Researchers the personal robots become the `sexbots` to satisfies the human desire it will made that person to treat all other in same way. In another side giving sexual gratification(pleasure of satisfaction) will reduce the violence in real world.
		- *Person hood*
			- Robots use the concepts of continuous learning(reinforcement learning) this will increase the thinking ability of robot  from mistakes.
			- If machine can perceive ,feel and act it will act like human these will cause some suffer to human.
			- EU suggest creating a legal status for sophisticated robots as `electronic persons` responsible for damage they may cause.
			- Giving person hood to robots will shift the moral Responsibility away from humans.
			- The primary objective discussed is whether AI systems should be granted legal person hood or moral agency, with a focus on the ethical, legal, and technical implications of this idea.
		
4. **Impact on financial system**
	- *Automation in financial markets*
		- Over half of the US equity trading volume attribute to algorithm
		- The amount of data in market are ideal for automation to make decision faster than human.
	- *Advantages of Algorithm trading*
		- AI algorithm faster then human traders,which is crucial in dynamic market environment.
		- This provide more profit over normal trading
	- *Consequence of autonomous trading*
		- Knight Capital Group’s automated agent caused significant losses by submitting millions of erroneous orders in August 2012. The company lost $460 million, and its stock value dropped by almost 75%.
	- *Market manipulation by autonomous agents*
		- It make crime like fake ordering 
		- Social bots can also artificially inflates stock prices through fraudulent promotion.
	- *Collusion and Price fixing*
	- *Accountability*

5. **Impact on the legal system:**
	- The creation of AI machines and their use in society could have a huge impact on criminal and civil law. The entire history of human laws has been built around the assumption that people, and not robots, make decisions
	- *Criminal law*
		- A crime consists of two elements : voluntary criminal and intention to commit a crime.
		- If the robot aware of those things then it commit the crime and easily escape itself from punishment by using the loop holes.
		- AI roles in crime(market manipulation,even physical offense)
		- Criminal responsibility - determining who is liable for the crimes is Challenges.
	- *Liability*
		- AI as an independent actor : if a AI system commit in any criminal activity it is crucial to assigning liability is difficult.
		- product liability : AI system could be considered products and under product liability law,the company behind the AI be held responsible for damages caused by defect or misuse of AI technology.
	- *Psychology*
		- AI and human behavior : The use of AI in legal processes could affect human psychology,especially in terms of trust,bias and perception of fairness.
		- Mental health assessments: AI assess the mental state of individual in criminal proceeding or psychological evaluation.
	- *Commerce ,Financial,Insolvency*
		- AI in financial systems : AI algorithm are widely used in trading ,which can have legal implications for Financial markets.It perform manipulation order spoofing can lead to financial crimes and legal disputes.
		- Insolvency: is a state of financial distress in which a person or business is unable to pay their debts.
	- *Offenses against the person*:
		- AI involvement in personal harms -AI based attacks on humans
		- protecting from AI-based harms: Formulating laws to protect humans form physical or Psychological harm caused by AI systems.
	- *Sexual Offense :*
		- AI and sexual exploitation : Deepfake technology for non consensual pornography or harassment.
		- Autonomous technology and consent: AI-driven devices may raise issues around consent ,privacy and sexual offenses ,requiring new legal frameworks to address these scenarios.
	- *Tort law:*
		- Tort law is a legal framework that addresses how to compensate people for harm caused by another person's actions. Torts are acts or omissions that cause harm to people or property, and tort law is the set of rules that address how to remedy that harm.
		- Negligence and AI : If a AI system neglect its mistake then who is liable
		- AI in personal injury case : In a personal injury case involving AI the law needs to consider how to compensate victims and how to faults is established when an AI is involved.

6. **Impact on the environment and the planet**
	- *Use of natural resources* 
		- The extraction of nickel, cobalt and graphite for use in lithium ion batteries – commonly found in electrical cars and smartphones - has already damaged the environment, and AI will likely increase this demand.
	- *Pollution and waste*
		- At the end of their product cycle, electronic goods are usually discarded, leading to a build-up of heavy metals and toxic materials in the environment
	 - *Energy concerns*
		 - As well as the toll that increased mining and waste will have on the environment, adoption of AI technology, particularly machine learning, will require more and more data to be processed. And that requires huge amounts of energy.
		 - AI will also require large amounts of energy for manufacturing and training – for example, it would take many hours to train a large-scale AI model to understand and recognize human language such that it could be used for translation purposes 
	- *Ways AI could help the planet*
		- Reduce the emission of green house gases by efficiently using the fuel with the help of algorithms.
		- It reduce the traffic congestion by finding the shortest path.
7. **Impact on trust**
	- The overwhelming consensus amongst the research community is that trust in AI can only be attained by *fairness, transparency, accountability and regulation.* 
	- These surveys suggest that there is some way to go before people are comfortable with the widespread use of robots and advanced technology in society. For example, while respondents favoured the idea of prioritising the use of robots in areas that pose risk or difficulty to humans — space exploration, manufacturing, military, security, and search and rescue, for instance — they were very uncomfortable with areas involving vulnerable or dependent areas of society
	- WHY TRUST IS IMPORTANT:
		- 'In order for AI to reach its full potential, we must allow machines to sometimes work autonomously, and make decisions by themselves without human input
		- Constantly supervising a machine learning algorithm used to make a decision would require significant time and resources, to the point that using digital technologies would become unfeasible. At the same time, however, the tasks with which we trust digital technologies are of such relevance that a complete lack of supervision may lead to serious risks for our safety and security, as well for the rights and values underpinning our societies.
	- FAIRNESS:
		- In order to trust AI it must be fair and impartial. As discussed in section 3.4, as more and more decisions are delegated to AI, we must ensure that those decisions are free from bias and discrimination
		- Statistical parity
		- conditional statistical parity
		- predictive equality
		- calibration
	
	 - TRANSPARENCY :
	- ACCOUNTABILITY
	- CONTROL 
	-
