1. **Definition of morality and ethics in AI**

- *Morality*
	- It refers to principle that govern behavior,distinguishing between rights and wrong based on societal,cultural ,personal values.
	- `In AI morality deals with how AI systems should behave ethically in various human context.`
	
- *Ethics*
	- This are formalized rules or principles or guidelines that outline acceptable behavior within specific domain.
	- `In AI ethics focuses on creating principles to ensure AI technologies do not harm individual or society.`
	
- *Report structure*
	1. Social Impacts
		- Potential impact of AI on labour market and economy 
		- different demographic people are ill treated, inequality,human rights,privacy.
		
	2.  Psychological Impacts:
	3. Financial Imapacts
	4. Legal system
	5. Environmental impacts
	6. Impact on trust

2. **Impcat on society**
	- LABOUR MARKET
		- Human power replaced with AI and automation
		- AI was implemented almost all the fields. 
		- Impact on economic growth and productivity
		
			- Economists are generally enthusiastic about the prospects of AI on economic growth. Roboticsadded an estimated 0.4 percentage points of annual GDP growth and labour productivity for countries between 1993 and 2007, which is of a similar magnitude to the impact of the introduction of steam engines on growth in the United Kingdom (Graetz and Michaels, 2015)
			
		- impact on the workforce
		
			-  Economists also disagree on the relative impactof AI and robotics. One study asked 1,896 experts about the impact of emerging technologies; *48 percent believed that robots and digital agents would displace significant numbers of both 'blue'and 'white' collar workers,* with many expressing concern that this would lead to vast increases in income inequality, large numbers of unemployable people, and breakdowns in the social order(Smith and Anderson, 2014)
			
			- Regardless, it is clear that a range of sectors will be affected. Frey and Osborne (2013) calculate that there is a high probability that 47 percent of U.S. workers will see their jobs become automated over the next 20 years. According to their analysis, *telemarketers, title examiners, hand sewers,mathematical technicians, insurance underwriters, watch repairers, cargo agents, tax preparers,photographic process workers, new accounts clerks, library technicians, and data-entry specialists have a 99 percent chance of having their jobs computerised*
			
		- Labour market discrimination: Effect on different demographic
			- Different demographic will be affected to varying extent and some are more at risk than others from emerging technologies.
			- According to the U.S. Department of Education (2014), there will be a 14 percent increase in STEM(Science ,Technology ,Engineering ,Math) jobs between 2010 and 2020 — but 'only 16 percent of American high school seniors are proficient in mathematics and interested in a STEM career.
			- Women may also be disproportionately affected, as more women work in caregiving positions — one of the sectors likely to be affected by robots.

	- INEQUALITY:
		- Inequality: exploitation of workers 
		
			- Changes in employment related to automation and digitisation will not be expressed solely via job losses, as AI is expected to create many numerous and new forms of employment .
			- Building AI most often requires people to manage and clean up data to instruct the training algorithms. Better (and safer) AI needs huge training data sets and a whole new outsourced industry has sprung up all over the world to meet this need.
			
		- Sharing Benefits 
		
			- A US report on AI, automation, and the economy (2016) highlights the importance of ensuring that potential benefits of AI do not accumulate unequally, and are made accessible to as many people as possible
			- To ensure that AI's benefits are distributed fairly 
			- New guidelines and laws are made to provide the AI driven technologies to all the citizens.
			
		- Concentration of power among elites(Premium):
		
			- The power of AI are only in the hands of the internet giants in the world their company dependent full on that.
			- he accumulation of technological, economic and political power in the hands of the top five players Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon – affords them undue influence in areas of society relevant to opinion-building in democracies: governments, legislators, civil society, political parties, schools and education, journalism and journalism education and — most importantly — science and Research
			- Power of those big companies in different areas like (Financial,Public disclosure,collecting personal data)
			
		- Political instability:

	- PRIVACY ,HUMAN RIGHTS & DIGNITY:
		-   AI will have profound impacts on privacy in the next decade. The privacy and dignity of AI users must be carefully considered when designing service, care and companion robots, as working in people's homes means they will be privy to intensely private moments (such as bathing and dressing). However, other aspects of AI will also affect privacy. Smith (2018), President of Microsoft, recently remarked
		
		- Any one of us can be identified by facial recognition software or data mining of our shopping of social media habits (Pasquale, 2015). These online habits may indicate not just our identity, but our political or economic predispositions, and what strategies might be effective for changing these
		
		- Machine learning allows us to extract information from data and discover new patterns, and is able to turn seemingly innocuous data into sensitive, personal data. For example, patterns of social media use can predict personality categories, political preferences, and even life outcomes
		
		- AI applications based on machine learning need access to large amounts of data, but data subjects have limited rights over how their data are used (Veale et al., 2018). Recently, the EU adopted new **General Data Protection Regulations** (GDPR) to protect citizen privacy. However, the regulations only apply to personal data, and not the aggregated 'anonymous' data that are usually used to train models.
	- BIAS:
		- AI is created by humans, which means it can be susceptible to bias. Systematic bias may arise as a result of the data used to train systems, or as a result of values held by system developers and users. It most frequently occurs when machine learning applications are trained on data that only reflect certain demographic groups, or which reflect societal biases
		- `Example:`
			- The investigative journalism organisation ProPublica showed that COMPAS, a machine learning based software deployed in the US to assess the probability of a criminal defendant re-offending, was strongly biased against black Americans. *The COMPAS system was more likely to incorrectly predict that black defendants would reoffend, while simultaneously, and incorrectly, predicting the opposite in the case of white defendants*
			
			- Researchers have found that *automated advertisement distribution tools are more likely to distribute adverts for well-paid jobs to men than women* (Datta et al., 2015). AI-informed recruitment is susceptible to bias; an Amazon self-learning tool used to judge job-seekers was found to significantly favour men, ranking them highly 

			- Such databases regularly portray women performing kitchen chores while men are out hunting
			
			-  Searches for 'wedding gowns produce the standard white version favoured in western societies, while Indian wedding gowns are categorised as 'performance art' or 'costumes
	- DEMOCRACY :
		- As already discussed, the concentration of technological, economic and political power among a few mega corporations could allow them undue influence over governments — but the adoption and implementation of AI could threaten democracy in other ways too
		- Fake news and social media
		- This may be a good thing for politicians, but there is a great deal of evidence that AI-powered technologies have been systematically misused to manipulate citizens in recent elections, damaging democracy.
		
		- *During the 2016 US presidential election, pro-Trump bots have been found to have infiltrated the online spaces used by pro-Clinton campaigners, where they spread highly automated content,*
		- A recent report found that at least 28 countries — including both authoritarian states and democracies — employ 'cyber troops' to manipulate public opinion over major social networking applications 
		- **The end of democracies**
			- Some commentators have questioned whether democracies are particularly suited to the age of AI and machine learning, and whether its deployment will enable countries with other political systems to gain the advantage
