## [Process Management:](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpu-scheduling-criteria/?ref=lbp)

- Assign a processor to a process at a time
- It is also known as CPU or Process Scheduling.
- CPU scheduling decides the order and priority of the processes to run and allocates the CPU time based on various parameters such as CPU usage, throughput, turnaround, waiting time, and response time.
- Criteria of CPU scheduling

  1. ** CPU scheduling **
  2. ** Throughtput time ** -> The number of processes being executed or completed per unit time.
  3. ** Turnaround Time ** -> 
   `Turn Around Time =Completion Time-Arrival TIme`

  5. ** Waiting Time ** -> Time spent by the process in ready queue
  `Waiting time =Turnaround time-Burst time`
