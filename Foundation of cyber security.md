### Ethical principle in security

*Ethical concerns and laws related to counterattacks*
- In the U.S., deploying a counterattack on a threat actor is illegal because of laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, among others.

*International standpoint on counterattacks*

The International Court of Justice (ICJ), which updates its guidance regularly, states that a person or group can counterattack if: 

- The counterattack will only affect the party that attacked first.
    
- The counterattack is a direct communication asking the initial attacker to stop.
    
- The counterattack does not escalate the situation.
    
- The counterattack effects can be reversed.
