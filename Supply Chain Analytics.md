## Unit 1 :Introduction to Supply Chain Analytics

**SUPPLY CHAIN ANALYTICS**
- Supply chain analytics refers to the use of data and quantitative methods to improve decision-making throughout the supply chain.
- *Supply chain optimize the flood of goods,information and finance between the customer and distributors.*
- Ex:optimized delivery of the goods to customer on online shopping.

### Data science and Data analytics

## 1.Data Science:
- It extract meaningful information present in the data.
- use different algorithm to extract information,work on structured and unstructured data.
- It use statistical,computational and mathematics 

## 2. Data analytics
- It is used to get the conclusion by processing the raw data.
- Data analytics used to convert the large number of figures to plain text use full for decision making.
- It deal with the structure data.
- Statistical use is minimal or no use in data Analytics

  - Each components is used to interpret past performance,forecast demand and optimize  decision making.
  - Components
      - Predictive analytics 
	      -> It answer the questions "what will happen?"
	      -> Predict features events using historical data.
     - prescriptive analytics
	      -> It answer the question "what should we do?"
	      -> Give recommendation
     - Diagnostic analytics
     - descriptive analytics
	       -> provide insights based on historical data
	      ->  It answer the question "what happened?"

## 4. Supply Chain Partners and Analytics
- Partners -suppliers,customers,distributors and manufactures
- Analytics helps in monitoring relationship ,operation and performance among partners to increase the productivity and take optimize decision.

## 5. Problem Solving, Decision Making, and Analytics in Supply Chains
- It involve identifying and addressing the challenges such as
  `inventory shortage,bottlenecks ,inefficient operation and demand fluctuations.`
- It involve different interconnected stages and its is a complex one that make it susceptible to a variety of disruption.
- solution : data driven decision making which allows for identifications of root causes.

- **Key Aspects of Problem-Solving in Supply Chains**
	- Identifying challenges
	- The role of decision making

## 6 . Supply Chain Analytics Relevance to Service and Manufacturing

- Supply chain analytics plays a critical role in both service and manufacturing sectors for optimizing the operation,improving customer satisfaction and reducing cost.
- It use predictive models and analytics tools to make the decision using previous data.
- The application of analytics is differ on both the services and manufacturing sector.
	 - **supply chain in service sector**
	 
		- In the service sector supply chain analytics help to manage intangible services like resourcesKey Aspects of Problem-Solving in Supply Chains allocation and customer interactions.
		- **Key area of applications:**
		
			-> Demand Forecasting:
			
			 _Airlines:_ Southwest Airlines uses predictive analytics to forecast demand and optimize flight schedules, ticket pricing, and fuel consumption
			->customer interaction:
			
			 _Call Centers:_ Leading telecom companies use customer interaction analytics to track call durations, resolution rates, and customer satisfaction scores.
			
		
	- **Supply Chain Analytics in the Manufacturing Sector**
	
		- It used for planning,inventory management and supplier relationships and logistics
		- Key areas of applications:
		
			->Production Scheduling:
			
			_Automotive Industry:_ Toyota employs analytics-driven manufacturing systems, including predictive maintenance and just-in-time (JIT) inventory.
			-> Inventory control:
			
			_Electronics Manufacturing:_ Samsung uses analytics to optimize its supply chain by balancing inventory levels across global production sites.
			
## 7.  Supply chain analytics life cycle:

- **Data collections**
- **Data Integration**
- **Data analysis**
- **Data interpretation**
- **Implementation of insights**
- **Continuous improvement**
## 8. Overview of Four-Process SCM Framework

- Plan :
	 The planning phase is the foundation of the entire supply chain process ,where strategies and goal are developed for the customer demand.

     Key elements :
     - Demand forecasting
     - capacity planning
     - Inventory planning
     - Financial planning
- Source:
	 - In this phase selecting suppliers and managing and procurement of material ,goods and services has been done.

     Key elements:
     - Supplier selection
     - Supplier relationship management
     - Procurement management

- Make
     - It involve converting a raw goods in finished product.
     - packaging the products and preparing for distribution
     
     Key elements:
    - Production scheduling
    - Manufacturing
    - Quality of control
    - Packaging and labeling

- Delivery: 

	 - It focus on the logistic and distribution of products to customer.
	 - It involves management ,warehousing,transportation and customer services

	 Key elements:
	 - Order fulfillment
	 - Transportation and logistics
	 - customer services and returns management
## 9. Overview of three SCA categories:

- Descriptive:

	Descriptive analytics is the process of analyzing historical data to understand past performance and trends within the supply chain. It answers the questions, **“What happened?”** and **“Why did it happen?”**

	 key functions:
	 - Data Aggregation
	 - Data mining
	 - Data visualization
	 
- Predictive analysis:
	Predictive analytics involves the use of statistical models, machine learning algorithms, and data mining techniques to forecast future outcomes or behaviors based on historical data. It answers the question, **“What is likely to happen?”**

	 Key function:
	 - Forecasting
	 - Risk Assessment
	 - Scenario Analysis

- Prescriptive analysis:
	Prescriptive analytics uses optimization techniques and algorithms to recommend specific actions or decisions based on the analysis of data. It answers the question, **“What should we do?”** 

	 Key functions:
	 - Optimization Models
	 - Decision support
	 - Automated Decision making
