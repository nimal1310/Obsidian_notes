## Unit 1 :Introduction to Supply Chain Analytics

**SUPPLY CHAIN ANALYTICS**
- Supply chain analytics refers to the use of data and quantitative methods to improve decision-making throughout the supply chain.
- *Supply chain optimize the flood of goods,information and finance between the customer and distributors.*

- **Continuous improvement**
## 8. Overview of Four-Process SCM Framework

- Plan :
	 The planning phase is the foundation of the entire supply chain process ,where strategies and goal are developed for the customer demand.

     Key elements :
     - Demand forecasting
     - capacity planning
     - Inventory planning
     - Financial planning
- Source:
	 - In this phase selecting suppliers and managing and procurement of material ,goods and services has been done.

     Key elements:
     - Supplier selection
     - Supplier relationship management
     - Procurement management

- Make
     - It involve converting a raw goods in finished product.
     - packaging the products and preparing for distribution
     
     Key elements:
    - Production scheduling
    - Manufacturing
    - Quality of control
    - Packaging and labeling

- Delivery: 

	 - It focus on the logistic and distribution of products to customer.
	 - It involves management ,warehousing,transportation and customer services

	 Key elements:
	 - Order fulfillment
	 - Transportation and logistics
	 - customer services and returns management
## 9. Overview of three SCA categories:

- Descriptive:

	Descriptive analytics is the process of analyzing historical data to understand past performance and trends within the supply chain. It answers the questions, **“What happened?”** and **“Why did it happen?”**

	 key functions:
	 - Data Aggregation
	 - Data mining
	 - Data visualization
	 
- Predictive analysis:
	Predictive analytics involves the use of statistical models, machine learning algorithms, and data mining techniques to forecast future outcomes or behaviors based on historical data. It answers the question, **“What is likely to happen?”**

	 Key function:
	 - Forecasting
	 - Risk Assessment
	 - Scenario Analysis

- Prescriptive analysis:
	Prescriptive analytics uses optimization techniques and algorithms to recommend specific actions or decisions based on the analysis of data. It answers the question, **“What should we do?”** 

	 Key functions:
	 - Optimization Models
	 - Decision support
	 - Automated Decision making
